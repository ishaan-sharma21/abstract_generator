# Medical Abstract Generator

This Python script generates medical abstracts based on user input specifying the gene and disease of interest, with the ability to choose the nature of the relationship (neutral, positive, or negative) between them. It leverages the OpenAI GPT-4 API to create responses that are contextually relevant to the input parameters.
